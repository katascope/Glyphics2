Eventually, it doesn't really matter.

That is, people can try to spew hate.. but hate just begets hate - and they hurt themselves. People can try to repress words but that doesn't stop or even slow hate. It just changes it. People can downvote you in anger.. but that's just hate begetting hate again. People can write spiteful mean things against people they see as mean.. and that's just hate begets hate again. The mob can rise in righteous hateful fury against someone's unpopular, and it's all still the same.

The escape is to shrug off the hate entirely. Just rise above it all and refuse to feed it. 	</div>
