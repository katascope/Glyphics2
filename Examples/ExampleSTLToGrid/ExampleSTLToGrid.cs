     * Purpose: Illustrate process for importing STL, rendering to Grid, output to new Grid
     * 
     * Example Concepts:
     *  1) Create Grid by API
     *  2) Loading Triangles from STL file
     *  3) Rendering Triangles to an Grid
     *  4) Rendering 3D Grid to oblique 2D Grid
     *  5) Saving Grid to PNG file
